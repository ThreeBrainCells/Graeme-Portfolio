# Graeme-Portfolio
This is my porfolio of work for my DU-DEN Bootcamp

To my understanding my assignment was to create a framework for what will become my real portfolio, with placeholders in all but one of the work sections, while also demonstrating my knowledge of responsive design using flexboxes and pseudo-classes.

This is the result:[my portfolio]()
